# Oloste Track

## Hackathon Project Levels:

- Level 1: Create a basic web scraper using Node.js that collects data from a single webpage and prints it to the console.
- Level 2: Enhance the scraper to store the collected data in a MongoDB database. Ensure that the scraper can handle basic errors like page not found (404) gracefully.
- Level 3: Build a full-stack application where users can input a URL, and the application scrapes the data and displays it on a web page using Express and a basic frontend.
- Level 4: Add a CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys the application to a server when changes are pushed to the repository. Optionally, add basic logging and monitoring.
